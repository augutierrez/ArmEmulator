# ArmEmulator

ArmEmulator is a program written in C that can execute ARM machine code by emulating the register state of an ARM CPU and emulating the execution of ARM instructions.  

It can emulate the execution of machine code for 5 given programs:
- Apply the quadratic equation to passed numbers (quadratic_a)
- Find the max number of a the passed array (find_max_a)
- Find the sum of a passed array (sum_array_a)
- Find nth Fibonacci number through iteration (fib_iter_a)
- Find nth Fibonacci number through recursion (fib_rec_a)

The program also provides Dynamic Analysis of : 
Computation (data processing),
Memory,
and Branches operations.

It also simulates a cache and reports:
Cache misses
Cache hits
Hit ratio
Miss ratio
